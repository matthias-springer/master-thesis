\chapter{Use Cases}

\section{Avoiding Clasds Name Clashes}
example: multiple games, all providing game class

\section{Module Versioning}
example: multiple versions of the same module in the same image

\section{Dependency Management}
example: app that requires a specific version (defining local alias), then all access goes through that method. example: external configuration of modules with parameterized classes (alternative to dependency injection)

\section{Readability and Understandability}
example: large project, where parts of the code can now be understood, given that we have hierarchical nesting. could be an example where grouping according to multiple criteria is needed (would result in n x m packages)

\section{Mixin Modularity with Parameterized Classes}

\section{Class Generator Pattern}
\label{sec:usecase_classgen}
better syntax for class generators

\section{Extension Methods}
better way is needed (e.g., class boxes, refinements, COP). return already existing class in generator method
